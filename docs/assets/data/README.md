# üêª üé© "Bears Will Be Boys" Data 

This folder contains data used in *The Pudding* essay **[‚ÄúBears Will Be Boys,‚Äù](https://pudding.cool/2025/07/kids-books/)** which explores how gender is assigned to anthropomorphized animals.

We share a curated dataset of animals featured in popular children‚Äôs picture books as well as animal stories written by 1.3k+ participants. For this project, we also generated animals stories with OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4o. We did not include this data source in our essay, but we share it here.

## Methods

### How did we select these books?

We identified ~30 popular children‚Äôs books with anthropomorphic animals for every decade since 1950, plus a catch-all category for everything before 1950.

To do so, we first compiled a general dataset of English-language picture books that have been popular in the 21st century. We collected information about books that were [tagged as a ‚Äúpicture book‚Äù](https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/picture-books) the most times or included in a [list of well-known picture books](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/107582) on Goodreads. We added picture books that have appeared on the [_New York Times_ bestseller list](https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/picture-books/) for Children‚Äôs Picture Books or picture books that were tagged as ‚Äúanimals‚Äù in the [Children‚Äôs Book Database](https://dlp.lib.miamioh.edu/picturebook/) at Miami University.

To find picture books that specifically feature animals, we selected any book that had ‚Äúanimals‚Äù as one of its top Goodreads tags; any book that was tagged as ‚Äúanimals‚Äù in the Children‚Äôs Book Database; or any book that GPT-4o identified as featuring animals (after being prompted with its title, author, and description). We manually evaluated every book and every representation of animals, so we used this approach to reduce a large dataset to a manageable size. We excluded anthologies and collections, like Grimm‚Äôs Fairy Tales.

We then ranked the remaining books by number of Goodreads ratings and selected the top ~30 books from every decade category.

### How did we identify gender?

We identified the gender of animals based on how they were referenced in the text: with feminine (she/her), masculine (he/him), or neutral (it/its, they/them) pronouns; with a gendered honorific (e.g., Mr., Ms.) or familial role (e.g., brother, mother); or simply by their animal name (e.g., the frog) or a character name. In this dataset, we only share animal characters referenced as she/her, he/him, it/its, or with a gendered honorific (Ms., Mr.) or familial role (mother, brother).

### What counts as anthropomorphic and ‚Äúimportant to the story‚Äù?

We include animal characters that meet the following criteria: 1) the animal exists (or existed) in the real world; 2a) the animal is an active subject at some point in the book; 2b) the animal has dialogue or plays a role in the story; 3) the animal has at least one anthropomorphic quality (e.g., clothing, speech, upright walking, jobs, personality, uses tools, facial expressions, complex relationships, cultural behavior, lives in a house, etc.). We exclude animals that were only referred to as a group or in a plural form (e.g, ‚Äú‚Ä¶ said the birds‚Äù, ‚Äúthe squirrels jumped‚Äù).
